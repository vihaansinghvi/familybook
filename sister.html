            <p>My sister's name is Khanak. She is 6 years old and I am 10. We both play a lot and enjoy every single moment. I am lucky to have her as my sister. We both are learning french on a app and I am teaching her to drive a 2 wheeler cycle from just 2 days before. I love my sister more than anything in the world. She is only my diamond, ruby, gold, silver, copper, limestone etc etc. I don't need anything other than my family including my pets. I feel very lonely when I am without her. Even if I am with my brother and she is not there. She is my heart and I feel her every single moment.</p>
