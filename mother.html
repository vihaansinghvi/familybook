    <body><center><i><p>My mother's name is Pallavi, she is very adorable. She is meticolous towards me and my sister's studies. I love her a lot. She appreciates for every single work I do. If I just make a drawing, thousands of claps for me!! She makes tasty food for us....especially chocolate cake...yumm. I am always striving to achieve it. Though..my experience in lockdown is not great at all...but, YES!! My mother is the solution for all problems! We are always thankful to our mother. </p>
